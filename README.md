# Interoperability Now! #
Interoperability Now! is a group working to improve the interoperability of tools and technology within the localization industry.

## Interoperability Now! Announces Release of XLIFF:doc and TIPP Translation Interoperability Formats ##
Interoperability Now! (IN!) is pleased to announce that the XLIFF:doc and TIPP translation interoperability formats have been finalized. IN! is an industry-driven initiative to finally provide real interoperability between translation systems and tools, something that has been woefully missing in the Localization Industry.

## Two Quick Introductions to Translation Tool Interoperability ##
Andrzej Zydroń from XTM International talks about the need for translation package interoperability at LT-Innovate:

## What are we producing? ##
We have two primary areas of focus:
  * **TIPP** - The Translation Interoperability Protocol Package (TIPP) is an information container that allows the seamless exchange of information between different independent Translation Management Systems (TMS).
  * **XLIFF:doc** - A reference guide for representing documents in XLIFF files. The primary goal of XLIFF:doc is to provide a mechanism to allow lossless exchange of XLIFF data between tools in the localization workflow.

Our [downloads](http://code.google.com/p/interoperability-now/downloads/list) page includes the most recent versions of the specifications and schema files. We have also made source code available for tool vendors interested in supporting the specifications to [programmatically manipulate TIP packages](http://code.google.com/p/interoperability-now/wiki/jtip).

## What organizations are implementing TIP? ##
Many companies and organizations are already working on TIP implementations. Please see the [list of known implementers](wiki/ListOfImplementers). If your organization is also implementing TIP, and you want to be listed, please let us know. We also have a mailing list specifically for teams implementing, or planning to implement, TIP. Please contact us if you would like to get on the mailing list.

## How do we get involved? ##
If you are working on implementing TIP, join the [implementers' list](http://interoperability-now.org/mailman/listinfo/implementers_interoperability-now.org).

## Are we working with other interoperability initiatives? ##
Yes! We are working with the [Language Interoperability Portfolio Project (LINPORT)](http://linport.org/) to ensure that both initiatives produce a single container package format.

## Recent accomplishments ##
  * An [online validator tool](http://snacks.dyndns.org/tipp) is now available for TIPP 1.5. Check your TIPPs to see if they are valid.
  * Version 1.5 of the TIPP format has been released.  More information can be found on the [TIPP15](wiki/TIPP15) wiki page.
  * Please see our [meeting notes](http://code.google.com/p/interoperability-now/wiki/meetings) and [updates](http://code.google.com/p/interoperability-now/updates/list) pages for on-going updates. Please also see our [Conferences](http://code.google.com/p/interoperability-now/wiki/conferences) page for details on presentations that we’ve given at different industry conferences.
